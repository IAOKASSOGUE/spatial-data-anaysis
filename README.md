# spatial-data-anaysis
Welcome to Spatial Analysis.
Spatial data is ubiquitous and spatial analytics are more important than ever. 
There is no doubt that Python has become one of main computer languages for geospatial analysts and researchers. 
This project is a great place to kick-start your journey into Python programming for Geospatial data. 

The present work is a solution for an exam paper. It illustrates the basics in spatial analysis.

I am available for any question related. 

Thank you
